# Erik Cowley's dot files

Includes my customization related to:
 * zsh - show Python virtual env info in prompt
 * vim - lots of plugins and custom shortcuts
 * ctags

Recommended workflow:
 1. Install oh-my-zsh
 2. Copy `cowley.zsh` to `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/`
 3. Copy `cowley.zsh-theme` to `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/`
 4. Copy `.zshrc` to your home directory
 5. Install vim's Vundle plugin
 6. Copy `.vimrc` to your home directory
 7. Open vim and run `:VundleUpdate` to install plugins
 8. Rename `vim.py` to vim and place it in your path in a higher precedence than
    the vim executable
 9. Copy `.ctags` to your home directory
