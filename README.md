# Erik Cowley's dot files

Includes my customization related to:
 * zsh - show Python virtual env info in prompt
 * vim - lots of plugins and custom shortcuts
 * ctags

Recommended workflow:
 1. Install oh-my-zsh
 2. Copy cowley.zsh to ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/
 3. Copy cowley.zsh-theme to ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/
 4. Copy .zshrc to your home directory
 5. Install vim's Vundle plugin
 6. Copy .vimrc to your home directory
 7. Open vim and run :VundleUpdate to install plugins
 8. Rename vim.py to vim and place it in your path in a higher precedence than
    the vim executable
